# orm - E-commerce Back End

Description

This repo contains refactored backend for an ecommerce site. It utilises Express.js, MySQL and Sequelize. Users are able to get, post, put and delete products, tags and categories.

Users need to add a .env file with their MySQL password, local host and database name (ecommerce_db). Users also need to source the schema file and seed database (run: npm run seed) before starting the server (run: npm start). The complete procedure from download to testing the routes using Insomnia is shown in the walkthrough video below.
